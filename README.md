# AllTheIcons

Inspired by [Every Icon](http://www.numeral.com/panels/everyicon.html), a digital art piece that will eventually display every 32Ã—32 pixel black-and-white icon. Built for [#MegaFavNumbers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLar4u0v66vIodqt3KSZPsYyuULD5meoAo).

AllTheIcons is an iOS app that lets you interact with the icon grid from Every Icon. It supports the following interactions:

- Tap and drag to draw on the grid (this works better if you have an Apple Pencil or a trackpad). Draw on black pixels to turn them white, and white pixels to turn them black.
- Drag the slider to see the images that correspond to different numbers. The upper left corner of the grid is the least significant bit, and the lower right corner of the grid is the most significant bit.
- Click the `+` or `-` buttons to increment or decrement the number, and the grid will update accordingly.

## A Note on Performance

AllTheIcons has not been tested on an iOS device, just the iOS simulator. It is quite slow in Debug mode, which I believe is due to safety checks inside the Swift-BigInt library. Run with the AllTheIcons Release scheme for interactive performance.

AllTheIcons uses the [Swift-BigInt](https://github.com/mkrd/Swift-BigInt) library:
